Changes in 0.3.1-alpha (Tue Oct 15 2013)
  - Change default database to leveldb
    NOTE: This does mean you will have to redownload the block chain.  Since we
    are still in alpha, we didn't feel writing a converter was worth the time as
    it would take away from more important issues at this stage
  - Add a warning if there are multiple block chain databases of different types
  - Fix issue with unexpected EOF in leveldb -- https://github.com/conformal/btcd/issues/18
  - Fix issue preventing block 21066 on testnet -- https://github.com/conformal/btcchain/issues/1
  - Fix issue preventing block 96464 on testnet -- https://github.com/conformal/btcscript/issues/1
  - Optimize transaction lookups
  - Correct a few cases of list removal that could result in improper cleanup
    of no longer needed orphans
  - Add functionality to increase ulimits on non-Windows platforms
  - Add support for mempool command which allows remote peers to query the
    transaction memory pool via the bitcoin protocol
  - Clean up logging a bit
  - Add a flag to disable checkpoints for developers
  - Add a lot of useful debug logging such as message summaries
  - Other minor bug fixes and general code cleanup
